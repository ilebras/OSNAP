For Freshwater scripts

**In pre-proj-OSNAPgeneral folder:** scripts for producing figures I have used in past talks about reference salinity, and OSNAP-wide context of freshwater transport for EGC

**In old folder:** Scripts that have generally run their course, deadends, re-writes, etc. Keeping them around because I may want to refer back to them.

**Load...** scripts generally are for loading a dataset and checking it out and/or re-saving it in a format that will be of more use and faster in another script.

**Getandplot_MOC_and_WM.py:** Calculate MOC sigma_max at OSNAP for NORESM and obs + Get Water Mass weighted transports and properties for all sections. Also has lots of plotting.

**NorESM_budgets.py** Working on NorESM budget terms...

**FreshSens_Budget_Optimize_1912.py**: Building inverse model framework

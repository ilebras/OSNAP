For Freshwater scripts

**In pre-proj-OSNAPgeneral folder:** scripts for producing figures I have used in past talks about reference salinity, and OSNAP-wide context of freshwater transport for EGC

**In old folder:** Scripts that have generally run their course, deadends, re-writes, etc. Keeping them around because I may want to refer back to them.

**Load...** scripts generally are for loading a dataset and checking it out and/or re-saving it in a format that will be of more use and faster in another script.

**Load_NorESM_AllSecs_getWM_OSNAP_MOC.py:** Loads the NorESM sections, rotates, renames, gets density, and resaves in the format that I want. Also in this script (and may want to separate out)

*  Calculate MOC sigma_max (e.g.) for NorESM sections and OSNAP obs (and save)

* Get Water Mass weighted transports and properties for NorESM only (!) Now doing obs in:

  â€‹	**Get_WM_fromObs.py**

**Plot_Summary_1912...** houses a comparison between NorESM and Obs

**NorESM_Budget_Check.py** Working on NorESM budget terms...

**FreshSens_Budget_Optimize_1912.py**: Building inverse model framework
